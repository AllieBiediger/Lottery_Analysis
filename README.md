# Suicide_Rates_and_Health_Concerns_for_Children
This project aimed to develop a predictive model for suicide risk among children under 18 using demographic and health-related data. By employing exploratory data analysis and regression techniques, I identified key predictors of suicide rates while conducting data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to support suicide prevention efforts.
